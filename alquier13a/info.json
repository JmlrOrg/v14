    "abstract": "Let <i>(<b>X</b>, Y)</i> be a random pair taking values in <i>&#8477;<sup>p</sup> &#215; &#8477;</i>. In the so-called single-index model, one has <i>Y=f<sup>*</sup>(&#952;<sup>* T</sup><b>X</b>)+<b>W</b></i>, where <i>f<sup>*</sup></i> is an unknown univariate measurable function, <i>&#952;<sup>*</sup></i> is an unknown vector in <i>&#8477;<sup>d</sup></i>, and <i>W</i> denotes a random noise satisfying <i> E[<b>W</b>|<b>X</b>]=0</i>. The single-index model is known to offer a flexible way to model a variety of high-dimensional real-world phenomena. However, despite its relative simplicity, this dimension reduction scheme is faced with severe complications as soon as the underlying dimension becomes larger than the number of observations ('<i>p</i> larger than <i>n</i>' paradigm).  To circumvent this difficulty, we consider the single-index model estimation problem from a sparsity perspective using a PAC-Bayesian approach. On the theoretical side, we offer a sharp oracle inequality, which is more powerful than the best known oracle inequalities for other common procedures of single-index recovery. The proposed method is implemented by means of the reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo technique and its performance is compared with that of standard procedures.",
