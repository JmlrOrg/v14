    "abstract": "This paper introduces the rllib as an original C++ template-based library oriented toward value function estimation. Generic programming is promoted here as a way of having a good fit between the mathematics of reinforcement learning and their implementation in a library. The main concepts of rllib are presented, as well as a short example.",
