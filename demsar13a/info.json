    "abstract": "Orange is a machine learning and data mining suite for data analysis through Python scripting and visual programming. Here we report on the scripting part, which features interactive data analysis and component-based assembly of data mining procedures. In the selection and design of components, we focus on the flexibility of their reuse: our principal intention is to let the user write simple and clear scripts in Python, which build upon C$++$ implementations of computationally-intensive tasks. Orange is intended both for experienced users and programmers, as well as for students of data mining.",
