    "abstract": "Divvy is an application for applying unsupervised machine learning techniques (clustering and dimensionality reduction) to the data analysis process. Divvy provides a novel UI that allows researchers to tighten the action-perception loop of changing algorithm parameters and seeing a visualization of the result. Machine learning researchers can use Divvy to publish easy to use reference implementations of their algorithms, which helps the machine learning field have a greater impact on research practices elsewhere.",
