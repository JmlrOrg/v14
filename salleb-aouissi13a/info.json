    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose <code>QuantMiner</code>, a mining quantitative association rules system. This system is based on a genetic algorithm that dynamically discovers \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood\u00e2\u0080\u009d intervals in association rules by optimizing both the support and the confidence. The experiments on real and artificial databases have shown the usefulness of <code>QuantMiner</code> as an interactive, exploratory data mining tool.",
