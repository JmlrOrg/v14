    "abstract": "Low dimensional embeddings of manifold data have gained popularity in the last decade. However, a systematic finite sample analysis of manifold embedding algorithms largely eludes researchers. Here we present two algorithms that embed a general $n$-dimensional manifold into $\\R^d$ (where $d$ only depends on some key manifold properties such as its intrinsic dimension, volume and curvature) that <em>guarantee</em> to approximately preserve all interpoint geodesic distances.",
